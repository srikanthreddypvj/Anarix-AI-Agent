# Anarix AI Agent for E-commerce Data Question Answering

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project goal was to develop an AI-powered agent capable of answering questions based on e-commerce datasets. The agent receives natural language questions through an API, translates them into SQL queries, and returns accurate, human-readable responses.

## 📊 Datasets Used

* Product-Level Ad Sales and Metrics
* Product-Level Total Sales and Metrics
* Product-Level Eligibility Table

## 🧠 Project Objective

* Build an AI Agent that:

  * Accepts questions via API.
  * Converts them to SQL queries using a local LLM.
  * Retrieves and formats results from a SQL database.
* (Bonus Features)

  * Visualize query results using charts.
  * Provide streamed, real-time-like response outputs.


## 🚧 Limitations

Due to **hardware constraints** (limited RAM, storage, and processing power on my personal laptop), I was unable to fully utilize more powerful LLMs or implement complex features like:

* High-accuracy models (e.g., GPT-4, Mistral-7B) for SQL translation.
* Advanced chart rendering and real-time streaming.
* Thorough testing and fine-tuning of edge case queries.

## ✅ Example Questions Supported

* What is my total sales?
* Calculate the RoAS (Return on Ad Spend).
* Which product had the highest CPC (Cost Per Click)?

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Integrate larger or cloud-based models for better natural language understanding.
* Add full visual support using dashboards.
* Optimize for performance and accuracy under real workloads.
